# taco
The source code is referenced from the book &lt;Spring In Action 5e>

I customized some functionalities.

If you want to start it, make sure that the application.yml files are fit for your environment.

For security, I've been keeping it private. Because the unencoded password in the application.yml file maybe remains in the commit history.But now I need to show it for finding a job.

~~ However, I've never eat tacos yet ~~
