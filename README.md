# taco
The source code is referenced from the book &lt;Spring In Action 5e>

I customized some functionalities.

If you want to start it, make sure that the configurations in application.yml files or application.properties files are fit for your environment. You can simply test it in VSCode with the related plugin. In spring dashboard, you need first to start the "config" module and "registry" module

For security, I've been keeping it private before. Because the unencoded password in the application.yml files maybe remains in the commit history. But now I need to show it for finding a job.

~~ However, I've never eat tacos yet ~~
